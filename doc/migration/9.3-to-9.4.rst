.. _9.3to9.4:

=============
v9.3 -> v9.4
=============

PyTango v9.4.0 is the first release which **only** supports Python 3.6 or
higher.  If you haven't moved all your clients and devices to Python 3, now
is the time!

PyTango v9.4.0 moved from cppTango 9.3.x to at least cppTango 9.4.1.  It
will not run with cppTango 9.4.0 or earlier.

In most cases, your existing PyTango devices and clients will continue to
work as before, however there are important changes.  Below you can find
the incompatibilities and the necessary migration steps.
